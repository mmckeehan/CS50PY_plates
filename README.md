# CS50PY_plates
This is my solution for a problem question for the CS50PY course.

What was needing to be done
1. Intake a string between 2 an 6 alpha-numeric characters
2. must start with 2 letters
3. once numbers start, you cannot use another letter
4. '0' cannot be the first number.

The output will either be 'Valid' or 'Invalid'
